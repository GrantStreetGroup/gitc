# Implement 'theirs' merge strategy which is the opposite of Git's
# builtin 'ours' strategy.
#
# The idea is to merge two branches making the current branch exactly
# match the other one.  It's used when promoting the entire master branch
# to the test branch.  We checkout the test branch and merge the master
# branch into it using 'theirs'.  This way, neither branch needs to be
# rewound and our conscious decision to choose 'master' over 'test' is
# preserved for future merges.
#
# This command must be called git-merge-theirs so that Git can find it.
